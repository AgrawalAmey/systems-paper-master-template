\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Modern systems face increasing demands for performance, scalability, and efficiency~\cite{dean2013tail}.
\sysname addresses these challenges through a novel combination of techniques that improve upon existing approaches~\cite{dean2013tail,barroso2017datacenter}.

This paper makes the following contributions:
\squishlist
  \item We identify key limitations in current systems (\sref{sec:background}).
  \item We present the design of \sysname, which addresses these limitations (\sref{sec:design}).
  \item We evaluate \sysname on representative workloads and demonstrate significant improvements (\sref{sec:eval}).
