\section{Background and Motivation}
\label{sec:background}

This section provides background on the problem domain and motivates the need for \sysname.

\heading{Problem context.}
Existing systems face challenges when scaling to large workloads.
Prior work has explored various approaches to address these issues~\cite{barroso2017datacenter}, but significant gaps remain.

\heading{Key insight.}
Our key observation is that current approaches fail to account for workload heterogeneity, leading to suboptimal resource utilization.
\sysname exploits this insight to achieve better performance.
