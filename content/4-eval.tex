\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

We evaluate \sysname to answer the following questions:
\squishlist
  \item How does \sysname compare to existing approaches on end-to-end workloads?
  \item What is the contribution of each design component?
\squishend

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:setup}

We implement \sysname in approximately 5,000 lines of code.
We compare against two baselines using standard benchmarks~\cite{dean2013tail}.

\subsection{End-to-End Results}
\label{sec:e2e}

\sysname achieves significant improvements over the baselines across all metrics.

\subsection{Ablation Study}
\label{sec:ablation}

We evaluate the contribution of each component by selectively disabling them.
Results confirm that both components are essential for achieving the full performance gains~\cite{barroso2017datacenter,lamport1998paxos}.
