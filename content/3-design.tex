This section describes the design of \sysname.

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

\sysname consists of three main components that work together to achieve high performance.

\subsection{Component A}
\label{sec:component-a}

The first component handles input processing and resource allocation.
It uses an adaptive algorithm to balance load across available resources.

\subsection{Component B}
\label{sec:component-b}

The second component manages scheduling and execution.
It builds on well-established techniques~\cite{lamport1998paxos} while introducing optimizations for our target workloads.
